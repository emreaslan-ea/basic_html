                     <p>
                          Years ago, when he was a little boy, he used to dream. If the Mona lisa painting was so expensive, why was it sold in markets? Our artist is aware of this, if you are reading this, it means you are aware of it. We are aware that art creates a sense of belonging. And we are most happy to achieve freedom in these ways. Feeling childhood in the digital designs of a child growing up on the street. After all, we all grew up with television and the telephone. We think we're going to be superheroes. As we grow older, we gradually accept it and it hurts us and we destroy it. We want to be free, we hug web3. We don't trust each other, but that's even less. Our battle is ourselves we rely on 0x. Welcome to the world where love is built with mathematics.

                      <p>
                          Our artist expressed art. Here every cold corner on the street is in our works. Only those who come from the street will hold this real art in their hands. Our numbers are limited and we teach. This collection will always remain in your subconscious. This art is a collection of pixels that your psychologist sees when he digs deep into your subconscious.

                        <p>
                            We would like to thank markets such as Opensea and Rarible for their support of the arts. We are also grateful to all the web3 artists whose names we could not name.
